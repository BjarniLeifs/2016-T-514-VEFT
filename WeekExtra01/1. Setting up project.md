# Setting up project.md
Assuming that we have already installed Express generator api. 

The first thing we need to to is to type in the following command in terminal and let's name the project VEFT

```	
	express-api VEFT & cd VEFT
	npm install

```

After this we should have new folder called VEFT and been moved to it. The folder structure should be as follow.


```
.
|
|-- bin				
|    -- www							* Create of server and other things related to it. 
|
|-- node_modules					* node installed dependancy for the project. ( after npm install )
| 									
|-- routes							* BACK END OF THE PROJECT IS ALL HERE
|
|-- app.js 							* Here we have configure of the server, what to use and more
|
|-- *
|       Other files are used for e.g. grunt, npm "package.json" and other .md files.
