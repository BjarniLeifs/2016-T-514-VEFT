# Setting up project.md
Assuming that we have already installed Express generator api. 

The first thing we need to to is to type in the following command in terminal and let's name the project VEFT

```	
	express-api VEFT & cd VEFT
	npm install
```

After this we should have new folder called VEFT and been moved to it. The folder structure should be as follow.


```
.
|
|-- bin				
|    -- www							* Create of server and other things related to it. 
|
|-- node_modules					* node installed dependancy for the project. ( after npm install )
| 									
|-- routes							* BACK END OF THE PROJECT IS ALL HERE
|
|-- app.js 							* Here we have configure of the server, what to use and more
|
|-- *
|       Other files are used for e.g. grunt, npm "package.json" and other .md files.
*
```

Now for our own sake we would want to add consolelog at the bottum to our bin/www file for our port. Meaning everytime we start the server we see what port the server is on, just in case we change it later.  

```
	function onListening() {
	  var addr = server.address();
	  var bind = typeof addr === 'string'
	    ? 'pipe ' + addr
	    : 'port ' + addr.port;
	  debug('Listening on ' + bind);
	}

	console.log("The server is on port " +  port);
```

After this we should try to type npm start in our terminal and see if everything is as it should be. Then we should get something like this in our terminal.

```
> VEFT@0.0.0 start .......
> node ./bin/www

The server is on port 3000 <------ the added line in bin/www
```
