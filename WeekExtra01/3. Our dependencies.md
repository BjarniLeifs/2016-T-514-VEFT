3. Dependencies
Now that we have finishing setting up the basics of our project. Looked into little example on how we can use package.json in development and got the server up and running as basic starting server. Our next step is to look at the dependencies we are using. If we look into our package.json file that is in the root of the project folder. Then it looks something like this. 


```
{
  "name": "VEFT",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.3.0",
    "body-parser": "~1.13.2",
    "cookie-parser": "~1.3.5",
    "express": "~4.13.1"
  }
}
```
For this project we will need to depend on few other things.

1.  bcryptjs
    If we look for tutorials online on how to make tokens, we will often see that the tutorial uses crypto-js in the project. However we will use bcryptjs. If we look at things we will soon see that yes bcryptjs is slower then crypto-js, but we need ask our selfs. Do we want speed or do we want to be more secure? 

    Most often we want to have speed, that's what the user wants. How ever when looking at security and the cost in speed is some ms, then everytime we choose security over the speed. The use of bcrypt will be slower and the reasone is that it does slower and more computationally expensive hashing, it will generally be for hashes where you really don't want an attacker to be able to reverse the hash (the password). If this is of no consirn then we could go with crypto. But it takes few minutes to hack same password with crypto-js vs years on bcryptjs. 

```
    npm install bcryptjs --save
```


2. express-jwt


3. jsonwebtoken


4. lodash


5. morgan


6. nodemailer


7. nodemailer-smtp-transport


8. pg


9. babel-eslint
