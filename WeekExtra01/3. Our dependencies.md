# Dependencies
Now that we have finishing setting up the basics of our project. Looked into little example on how we can use package.json in development and got the server up and running as basic starting server. Our next step is to look at the dependencies we are using. If we look into our package.json file that is in the root of the project folder. Then it looks something like this. 


```
{
  "name": "VEFT",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.3.0",
    "body-parser": "~1.13.2",
    "cookie-parser": "~1.3.5",
    "express": "~4.13.1"
  }
}
```
For this project we will need to depend on few other things.

*  [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
    
    If we look for tutorials online on how to make tokens, we will often see that the tutorial uses crypto-js in the project. However we will use bcryptjs. If we look at things we will soon see that yes bcryptjs is slower then crypto-js, but we need ask our selfs. Do we want speed or do we want to be more secure? 

    Most often we want to have speed, that's what the user wants. How ever when looking at security and the cost in speed is some ms, then every time we choose security over the speed. The use of bcrypt will be slower and the reason is that it does slower and more computationally expensive hashing, it will generally be for hashes where you really don't want an attacker to be able to reverse the hash (the password). If this is of no concern then we could go with crypto. But it takes few minutes to hack same password with crypto-js vs years on bcryptjs. 

```
    npm install bcryptjs --save
```


* [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt)

    Express-jwt is a middleware that validates JsonWebTokens and sets the req.user.* 
    This module lets us to authenticate HTTP requests when using JWT tokens (Json Web Tokens) in NodeJS. Where JWTs are used to protect API endpoints and authenticates callers. If the token is valid, req.user will be set with the JSON object decoded to be used by later middleware for authorization and access control.  

```
    npm install express-jwt --save
```

* [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)
  
    JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. JWT allows you to decode, verify and generate JWT. Go to [official JWT website](https://jwt.io) for more information. You can also use the debugger there to look at your token. 

```
    npm install jsonwebtoken --save
```

* [lodash](https://lodash.com)

    Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

      1. Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
      2. Manipulating & testing values
      3. Creating composite functions

    Go to the official [lodash](https://lodash.com) website and read the documentation there. This is a great library.

```
    npm install lodash --save
```

* [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)

    Morgan is used for logging request details to our terminal. It is for automated logging of requests, responses and related data. When we add it as a middleware to our express application, byt default it should log statements to "stdout" showing detail of; remote ip, request method, HTTP version, response status etc. We can modify the log using tokens or add color to them by defining 'dev' or even logging out to an output stream. 


```
    npm install morgan --save
```

* [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer)

    Nodemailer is used to send e-mail with NodeJs and makes it a breeze, this is useful for many things, such as if user wants to reset password, we then can send a reset token in e-mail url in e-mail were user then has to get it from their registered e-mail to verify it is the user, which then can reset the password. 

```
    npm install nodemailer --save
```

* [nodemailer-smtp-transport](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer-smtp-transport)
  
    If we want to send e-mails thought our existing account with some of the well known e-mail services, then nodemailer has this functionality built in and supports a lot of e-mail platforms including hotmail, gmail ect. In order to use this functionality we need our server to require both the nodemailer and nodemailer-smtp-transport module.

```
    npm install nodemailer-smtp-transport --save
```

* [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg)

    Since we are using PostgreSQL for this project, then we need to connect to our database from NodeJS somehow, here is where pg module comes in place, it handles all the connection for us. For this project we will not into much depth in using pg.

```
    npm install pg --save
```

* [babel-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-eslint)
    
    Babel-eslint is a parser that allows us to use ESLint with code that is supported by Babel (ES6+ features, etc.). ESLint on it's own only supports ES6, JSX and object, ect. Anything beyond that we will require babel-eslitn.


```
    npm install babel-eslint --save-dev
```


TLDR; Type in terminal and install above dependencies.

```
    npm install bcryptjs express-jwt jsonwebtoken lodash morgan nodemailer nodemailer-smtp-transport pg --save
    npm install babel-eslint --save-dev
```

After all this we should have our package.json looking something like this. Notice that we use babel-eslint in devDependencies, hence the --save-dev.
