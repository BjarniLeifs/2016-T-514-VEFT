# Setting up package.json
The best way to manage locally installed npm packages is to create a package.json file.
	
	1. A package.json file affords you a lot of great things:

	2. It serves as documentation for what packages your project depends on.

	3. It allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.

Makes your build reproducable which means that its way easier to share with other developers.

We wont go into much detail on what package.json is, rather get few example on how we can use package.json to are advantage. If you want to read more about package.json then you can find it [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) and [here](https://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/getting-started/npm/what-is-the-file-package-json/).


Package.json has few built in commands that we can use in scripts e.g. "start", "test", "install" and more you can read more about them [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). But we will look at how we can make our own commands and use them.  Lets look at an example of scripts.
```
{
	.
	.
	"scripts": {
    	"start": "node ./bin/www",
    	"global-mac": "sudo npm install package1 package2 ... package9 -g",
    	"global-win": "npm install package1 package2 ... package9 -g",
    	"setup-mac": "npm install && npm run createdb && npm run schemadb-mac",
    	"setup-win": "cscript WinPostgrInstall.vbs && npm install && createdb VEFT && psql -d VEFT -f sqlSchems/database.sql",
    	"createdb": "createdb VEFT",
    	"dropdb": "dropdb VEFT",
    	"schemadb-mac": "psql -d VEFT -f sqlSchems/database.sql",
    	"backupdb-mac": "cat ./sqlSchems/database.sql > ./sqlSchems/backup/database_`date +\"%d-%m-%Y\"`.sql",
    	"dumpdb": "pg_dump VEFT > ./sqlSchems/database.sql",
  	},
  	.
  	.
}
```


Start and install is one of those built in commands that we can use e.g. npm start or even npm install, but other in the example above are our own and to run them we need to add "run" to npm, "npm run *nameOfOurCommand*". This allows us to prescript simple and even complex scripts. 

If we look at the simple scripts e.g. "global-mac" then we see that the only thing it is doing is using sudo command with npm command that calls for installation on some package that we define. package1 could be "nodemon", for the flag -g we are installing the package on our machine globally. This is often used to setup things globally on developers machine that he might not have, hence making this script could be useful. 

Here is simple explanation on other simple scripts:
```
	"start"	 	  : Starting the server from bin/www.
    "global-mac"  : installing package globally to the computer good example would perhaps 
    				be [nodemon](http://nodemon.io).
    "global-win"  : same as above... but sometimes there are some difference between osX, 
    				windows and linux. 
	"setup-mac"   : Here we are just running few commands in specific order then we use && 
					between commands.
	"setup-win"   : Here we have same as in setup-mac but here we need to use more complex 
					scripting with WinPostgrInstall.vbs
	"createdb"    : Here we have added createdb command that is used in terminal for making 
					database in postgres
	"dropdb" 	  : Here we have added dropdb command that is used in terminal to drop 
					database in postgres
	"schemadb-mac": Again command in terminal for postgres to add database scheme that we 
					have in sqlschems. 
	"backupdb-mac": Here we are using basic commands for bash to take backup of our database 
					file and adding date.
	"dumpdb".     : Here we are taking advantage of postgres command pg_dump to make new 
					database file. 
```

We can therefore use package.json for many things and it can safe a lot of time when developing if we just take the time to define things, not only us but for the whole team that is developing with us. Now lets look at that cscript WinPostgrInstall.vbs file.


```
	' ------
	' VEFT Postgres install V 1.0
	' VB script for installing postgres onto windows machine
	' ------

	'---
	' Create connection to Shell in Windows (Command prompt)
	'---
		Set SystemFromShellObj = WScript.CreateObject( "WScript.Shell" )

	'---
	' Get current Users username
	'---
		UserStr = SystemFromShellObj.ExpandEnvironmentStrings( "%USERNAME%" )

	'---
	' Postgres with bigsql for windows  - Version. 9.5.3-5, change this to current version at any given point. 
	'---
		Wscript.Echo "Setting variables"
		FileUrlStr = "http://get.enterprisedb.com/postgresql/postgresql-9.5.3-1-windows-x64.exe"
		FileSaveStr = "C:\Users\" + UserStr + "\Documents\postgresql-9.5.3-1-windows-x64.exe"
		InstallLocationStr = "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.5"
		PsqlLocationStr = chr(34)+"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.5\bin\psql.exe"+chr(34)

	'---
	' Create http get request
	'---
		Wscript.Echo "Creating HTTP GET request"
		Set FetchFileObj = CreateObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP")
		FetchFileObj.open "GET", FileUrlStr, false
		FetchFileObj.send()

	'---
	' If success (status 200)
	'---
		Wscript.Echo "Checking status code on GET request"
		If FetchFileObj.Status = 200 Then
			Wscript.Echo "Downloading Postgres"
			Set FetchFileStream = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
			FetchFileStream.Open
			' Set as binary
			FetchFileStream.Type = 1 
			FetchFileStream.Write FetchFileObj.ResponseBody
			FetchFileStream.Position = 0 'Set the stream position to the start

		Set FileStreamObject = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

	'---
	' Delete file if it is allready existing at this location
	'---
		If FileStreamObject.Fileexists(FileSaveStr) Then FileStreamObject.DeleteFile FileSaveStr

	'---
	' Save to location that is predefined at start
	'---
		Wscript.Echo "Saving to file at location " + FileSaveStr +  " ***"
		FetchFileStream.SaveToFile FileSaveStr
		FetchFileStream.Close

	'---
	' Lets end the first if sentance
	'---
		End if
		
		Wscript.Echo "Finished downloading"

	'---
	' Lets run install
	'---
		Wscript.Echo "--------------------------------------------------------------"
		Wscript.Echo " Remember this will do a full install and finish the install  "
		Wscript.Echo " super account will be set to " + UserStr
		Wscript.Echo " super password will be set to 1234                           "
		Wscript.Echo " Location will be set at " + InstallLocationStr
		Wscript.Echo " Data directory will be set at " + InstallLocationStr + "\data"
		Wscript.Echo "--------------------------------------------------------------"

		SystemFromShellObj.run FileSaveStr + " --disable-stackbuilder 1 --mode unattended --superpassword 1234 --serverport 5432", 1, true

	'---
	' Adding new Role with your username and password 1234
	'---

		PsqlStr = chr(34) + "CREATE USER " + chr(92) + chr(34) + UserStr + chr(92) + chr(34) + " WITH PASSWORD " + chr(39) + "1234" + chr(39) + " SUPERUSER CREATEDB REPLICATION;" + chr(34)
		Wscript.Echo PsqlStr
		SystemFromShellObj.run PsqlLocationStr + " -d postgres -U postgres -c " + PsqlStr

	'---
	' Cleanup after Use
	'---
		Set FileStreamObject = Nothing
		Set FetchFileStream = Nothing
		Set FetchFileObj = Nothing
		Set SystemFromShellObj = Nothing

	Wscript.Echo "Install Finished and everything is setup as it is suppose to be"
```

The whole purpose of this file is to download and install PostgreSQL. Not only that it creates user name and sets the password to 1234 on the server. This can be useful to have, now the only thing the developer with windows only have to type in terminal. 

```
	npm run setup-win"
```

So what we have seen here in package.json is that it can be utilized as an powerful resource. Hence I urge you to learn how to use it.
