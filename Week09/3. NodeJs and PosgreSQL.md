# NodeJs and PosgreSQL
[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) is lightweight, minimalist web framework for Nodejs.
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.

Mongodb is the most popular database used with NodeJs, however as with all frameworks it is possible to use PostgreSQL. When looking at the project that is developed we need to ask our self what is the right tools. Often we need [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) therefore it is nice to know how to use PostgreSQL with Nodejs.

By know we should have some knowledge on how to build simple API with NodeJS and Express, if that is not the case then perhaps a good next step would be to read 1. NodeJS and 2. Express in week09. Then perhaps read the documentation for NodeJS and Express.

## Download and install. 

Assuming you already have Nodejs and Express installed, we will only need to install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), got to the official site and follow their instruction on how to setup.
